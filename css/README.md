# CSS / SCSS

## Syntax
* Use hard tabs 
* When grouping selectors, keep individual selectors to a single line.
* Include one space before the opening brace of declaration blocks for legibility.
* Place closing braces of declaration blocks on a new line.
* Include one space after : for each declaration.
* Each declaration should appear on its own line for more accurate error reporting.
* End all declarations with a semi-colon. The last declaration's is optional, but your code is more error prone without it.
* Comma-separated property values should include a space after each comma (e.g., box-shadow).
* Lowercase all hex values, e.g., #fff. Lowercase letters are much easier to discern when scanning a document as they tend to have more unique shapes.
* Use shorthand hex values where available, e.g., #fff instead of #ffffff.
* Quote attribute values in selectors, e.g., input[type="text"]. They’re only optional in some cases, and it’s a good practice for consistency.
* Avoid specifying units for zero values, e.g., margin: 0; instead of margin: 0px;.

```css
/* Bad CSS */
.selector, .selector-secondary, .selector[type=text] {
  padding:15px;
  margin:0px 0px 15px;
  box-shadow:0px 1px 2px #CCC,inset 0 1px 0 #FFFFFF
}

/* Good CSS */
.selector,
.selector-secondary,
.selector[type="text"] {
	padding: 15px;
	margin-bottom: 0 0 15px;
	box-shadow: 0 1px 2px #ccc, inset 0 1px 0 #fff;
}
```

## Class names
* Keep classes lowercase and use dashes (not underscores or camelCase). Dashes serve as natural breaks in related class (e.g., .btn and .btn-danger).
* Avoid excessive and arbitrary shorthand notation. `.btn` is useful for button, but `.s` doesn't mean anything.
* Keep classes as short and succinct as possible.
* Use meaningful names; use structural or purposeful names over presentational.
* Prefix classes based on the closest parent or base class.
* Use `.js-*` classes to denote behavior (as opposed to style), but keep these classes out of your CSS.
It's also useful to apply many of these same rules when creating Sass variable names.

```css
/* Bad example */
.t { ... }
.red { ... }
.header { ... }

/* Good example */
.tweet { ... }
.important { ... }
.tweet-header { ... }
```

## Selectors
* Use classes over generic element tag for optimum rendering performance.
* Avoid using several attribute selectors (e.g., `[class^="..."]`) on commonly occuring components. Browser performance is known to be impacted by these.
* Keep selectors short and strive to limit the number of elements in each selector to three.
* Scope classes to the closest parent only when necessary (e.g., when not using prefixed classes).

```css
/* Bad example */
span { ... }
.page-container #stream .stream-item .tweet .tweet-header .username { ... }
.avatar { ... }

/* Good example */
.avatar { ... }
.tweet-header .username { ... }
.tweet .avatar { ... }
```

## Media-queries
* Use mobile-first
* When using media-queries with scss nest them inside the selector. It makes them easy to find and manage.

```css

.article-header {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 20px;
	
  @media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    width: 75%;
    padding: 40px;
  }
}

```
